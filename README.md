Link: https://ai-travel-recommender.onrender.com/

An **AI-powered Travel Recommendation System** that predicts the **best travel destinations** based on:
- 🌍 Country  
- 🏖️ Category (City, Coastal Town, Lake, etc.)  
- 💰 Budget Preference (Low, Medium, High, etc.)  

This project uses **Machine Learning (Gradient Boosting & others)** to predict **cost-of-living trends** and recommend **top destinations** that best fit user preferences.

## 🚀 Features

✅ Predicts **cost-of-living trends** (Low, Medium, High, etc.)  
✅ Suggests **Top destinations** based on user inputs  
✅ Includes **case-insensitive input handling**  
✅ Compares multiple ML models to find the **best-performing algorithm**  
✅ Deployable as a **Flask web app** on Render / local machine  
✅ Beautiful web UI built with **HTML + CSS**
